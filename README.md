Hello student!

We've locked down the deploy `environment` so that our secret resources can't be retrieved by students. We also have some other protections in place to prevent student code from getting merged and potentially compromising that restriction!

Eventually we will be using these repositories to automatically grade your assignments, but for now they're just placeholders so please drop your assignments in here for manual grading while we get our workflows set up.

Thanks,

Octoversity Staff
